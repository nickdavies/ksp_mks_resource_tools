MKS Resource Tools
======================

A few functions for parsing MKS files and generating the wiki page for resource conversions.

Uses Python 3.


### Dependencies:

This depends on nothing other than https://bitbucket.org/ndavies/kerbal_part_parser which is commited into this repo (i know its kinda eww but I wanted it to 'just work'). It's a fork of https://bitbucket.org/johannestaas/kerbal_part_parser which is why its on bitbucket.
